# To Do

## General

* Config file?
* Command-line arguments

## Database / Persistence

* **Nested objects (inventory, f.e.)**
* Timing / tracking info for object persistence (# of each type, time to load each type)
* **Items lack "carried_by" "worn_by" attributes!**
* Items should point to their parent instance (worn_by/on, carried_by, location, etc)
* **Sanity checks on load.**
* Check scripts to scan the instances and template dirs and report/repair any problems
* This would validate we can load/save world items outside of pyrealm, which is a prereq for
* Offline World editor!
* ~~Generalized save/load to work with all types (items, rooms, players, npcs, shops, etc)~~
* ~~Move _checksum, _last_saved into base_object~~
* ~~Move "skip_list" into object as property to avoid having to pass it during save()~~
* ~~Boot_db() to load all world objects on startup~~
* ~~Create Templates vs Instances Save/Load functionality.~~
* ~~Resolve issues with gid collisions~~

## Items

* ~~Create base_item~~
* Create weapon, armor, book, food, potion, scroll, key, container,
         staff, wand, money, food, clothing, drink, trash, misc?

## Rooms

* ~~Move code to check/list exits into rooms.py (avoid importing DIR_*)~~
* ~~Update room info display to wrap based on width (down to maybe 40 chars)~~

## Characters / Chargen / Login

* Implement banned
* Implement badwords
* Implement races
* Implement random chargen

## Command Handler

* Create pager?
* ~~Text wrapping~~
* Create customizable prompt?
* Create score, help

### Expand command system based on states

The command table will include data about what the nominal state of a player
  must be in order to execute a command.  Give feedback on failures.

* Implement state (health / dead)
* Implement position (sitting, laying down, standing, flying, etc)
* ex. "land" - only works if flying
* ex. "run" only works if >= standing

### Complex commands

* runto: auto-move to a destination (by rooom name/area name)
      This should work only if you've been there before, which means keeping
      track of user-known rooms.  Do we want to do this?  (maybe eventually)
